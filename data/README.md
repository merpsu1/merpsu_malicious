# Datasets

We run our scheme on several public datasets to verify the correctness and effectiveness of our work. This document provides detailed information for these datasets.

## Dataset for Correctness

All datasets used for correctness are from testcases used in [Smile (Statistical Machine Intelligence and Learning Engine)](https://haifengl.github.io/). Smile is a fast and comprehensive machine learning, NLP, linear algebra, graph, interpolation, and visualization system in Java and Scala. Please visit the official website and the [GitHub](https://github.com/haifengl/smile) of Simle for more information.

We thank the sufficient unit tests for Gradient descent Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) provided in Smile. These unit tests demonstrate many special cases in GBDT training, helping us finding many bugs and problems to make our implementation more robust.

### Preprocess

We preprocess all datasets for correctness verifications with the following principles:

- All nominal **features** are one-hot encoded. The column name for each of the nominal values is under the format `ColumnName_NominalName`. The nominal value for the one-hot encoded column is 0 and 1.
- All nominal **labels** (when data is for classification tasks) remain unchanged.
- The dataset is in `csv` format. The first row describes the column name. The row data is separated by comma (`,`). The `NULL` data is left blank.

Take the dataset [abalone-train](https://github.com/haifengl/smile/blob/master/shell/src/universal/data/regression/abalone-train.data) as an example. We can find the dataset schema in [Abalone.java](https://github.com/haifengl/smile/blob/eb5f14eed4c0aa1474abdb1ef78f662f6dd87fea/base/src/test/java/smile/test/data/Abalone.java). The schema is printed as follows.

```text
[sex: byte nominal[F, M, I], length: double, diameter: double, height: double, whole weight: double, shucked weight: double, viscera weight: double, shell weight: double, rings: double]
```

The original dataset is as follows.

```text

......
```

First, the feature `sex` in the dataset Abalone contains three nominal values: F, M, and I. We encode `sex` in the one-hot manner to have three columns `sex_F`, `sex_M`, `sex_I`. For the row that has `sex` value `F`, we let `sex_F` be 1, while setting `sex_M` and `sex_I` to be 0. Then, we add a header row describing the column name. Finally, we save the dataset in `csv` format.

Since the dataset [abalone-train](https://github.com/haifengl/smile/blob/master/shell/src/universal/data/regression/abalone-train.data) is used for the regression task, we place it in the dictionary `regression/abalone/`. The re-formatted dataset is as follows.

```text

# Datasets for Effectiveness

We introduce 4 datasets from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) for the effectiveness tests. We further introduce a dataset from a real scenario for the large-scale experiment.

## Preprocess

We also follow the principles shown below to preprocess all datasets for effectiveness:

- All nominal **features** are one-hot encoded. The column name for each of the nominal values is under the format `ColumnName_NominalName`. The nominal value for the one-hot encoded column is 0 and 1.
- All nominal **labels** (for classification tasks) remain unchanged.
- The dataset is in `csv` format. The first row describes the column name. The row data is separated by comma (`,`). The `NULL` data is left blank.

In addition, we preprocess all numerical features with different ranges into discrete values in the range of \[0, 10\] to facilitate setting privacy parameters.
